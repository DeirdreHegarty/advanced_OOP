	The aim of this task part is to explain the internal workings of 
	how a class can be defined like this:
	class Person{
		Person friend; 
		//...
	}
	
	That is, to include an attribute who's type is 
	that of the class being defined ('friend' above of type 'Person').
 	If you're new to this concept it can be confusing. You may need to get to 
	a point where you feel: "ah, it's just a 'reference' of type 'Person'...".
	
	The task will get you to experiment until you are comfortable with 
	the concept.
