# TOPICS:

* Static
* Singletons
* Thread Safe Singletons
* Eager Initialization
* Lazy Initialization
* Initialization block (instance & static)
* Printing random 2 options

---

*eager evaluation* -  as soon as they are declared  
*lazy evaluation* -  evaluated only when their value is needed  

3 ways to assign a variable:
* declare and initialize at the top

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing = true;   //eager initialization
                      
  Bird(){             

  }
}
```
called **eager initialization**.    
advantage - dont have to make sure that each constructor sets it.  
disadvantage - if there is time consuming logic to run, it may take a while to process and may not even need to use the functionality.  

* declare at top and initialize inside constructor

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;    
                      
  Bird(){             
    canSing = true; 	//lazy initialization
  }
}
```
disadvantage - need to do inside every constructor in this class (if more than one constructor)   

* create `initialization block` / `init block` (block with no name)

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;   
  {
    canSing = true; 
  }
                      
  Bird(){             

  }
}
```

advantage - will "copy" contents into each constructor in the class   

---

**Order of execution:**  

1) static initialization blocks of super classes
2) static initialization blocks of the class
3) instance initialization blocks of super classes
4) constructors of super classes
5) instance initialization blocks of the class
6) constructor of the class  

---

#### Instance initialization block - Runs each time you instantiate an object

The instance initialization block is actually copied by the Java compiler into every constructor the class has. So every time the code in instance initialization block is executed exactly before the code in constructor.  

#### Static initialization block - Runs once (when the class is initialized)

The code in static initialization block will be executed at class load time (and yes, that means only once per class load), before any instances of the class are constructed and before any static methods are called.  

```java

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bird b1 = new Emu();
    Bird b2 = new Blackbird();
    System.out.println( b1.canSing ); // false
    System.out.println( b2.canSing ); // true
  }
}
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;    
                      
  Bird(){             
    
  }
}
class Blackbird extends Bird{
  Blackbird(){
    canSing = true;
  }
}
class Emu extends Bird{
  Emu(){

  }
}

```

**Printing Random**
```java

import java.util.Random;
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    randomA();
    System.out.println("******");
    randomB();
    
  }
  static void randomA(){
    Random random = new Random();;
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
      if( random.nextBoolean() == true)
        System.out.println( "a" );
      else
        System.out.println( "b" );
    }
  }
  static void randomB(){
    for(int i = 0; i < 5; i++){
      if( Math.random() > 0.5 )
        System.out.println( "a" );
      else
        System.out.println( "b" );
    }
  }
}

//* 
* sample output:
* b
* b
* a
* b
* a
******
* b
* b
* b
* b
* b

```

---


## Static

* Every class has a slot in the "shared space"
* every instance knows about its shared variables
* **think of it as** - static content is not part of the object (not actually true)

```java
class TicketSalesAgent
{
	static int totalSaleCount;	//A 'static' to count all sales
	int thisAgentSaleCount;		//An 'instance' to count this Agent's sales
	
	String agentName;
	
	TicketSalesAgent(String aName){
		agentName = aName;
	}
	
	void sellTicket(){
		System.out.println(agentName+" just sold 1 ticket");
		totalSaleCount++;			//add to total sale count
		thisAgentSaleCount++;		//add to this agent sale count
	}
}
class Runner{
	public static void main(String[] args){
		TicketSalesAgent pinky = new TicketSalesAgent("Pinky");
		TicketSalesAgent brain = new TicketSalesAgent("Brain");
		
		pinky.sellTicket();
		brain.sellTicket();
		brain.sellTicket();
		
		System.out.println( "tickets sold: "+TicketSalesAgent.totalSaleCount ); 
	}
}

//output:
// Pinky just sold 1 ticket
// Brain just sold 1 ticket
// Brain just sold 1 ticket
// tickets sold: 3

```

## Singleton - one object of a type to appear

**WARNING** multiple threads can break singleton property because they can access get instance method simultaneously and create multiple objects.

```java
class PokerDealer
{
	static PokerDealer _instance;	//static ref of same type as self 		
	static int numObjects;
	Deck deckOfCards;
	
	private PokerDealer()
	{
		System.out.println("PokerDealer()");
		numObjects++;
		deckOfCards = new Deck();
	}

	public static PokerDealer instance()   
	{
		System.out.println("instance()");
		if(_instance == null)
		{
			_instance = new PokerDealer(); 
		}
		
		return _instance;	//return instance that already has been set
	}
}
```

**COULD THE REAL SLIM SHADY PLEASE STAND UP? (NOT THREAD SAFE)**   

`https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-singleton-design-pattern-practices-examples/`  

```java

class SlimShady
{
	static SlimShady _real;	//static ref of same type as self 		
	static int numObjects;
	
	// can't be called from outside the class
	private SlimShady()
	{
		System.out.println("SlimShady()");
		numObjects++;
	}

	// important that this is static 
	public static SlimShady standUp()   
	{
		System.out.println("standUp()");
		if(_real == null)
		{
			_real = new SlimShady(); 
		}	
		return _real; //return instance that already has been set
	}
}

class Runner
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{	
		System.out.println("COULD THE REAL SLIM SHADY PLEASE STAND UP?");
		SlimShady slim1 = SlimShady.standUp();
		System.out.println("\tSlimShady.numObjects = "+SlimShady.numObjects+", \n\tslim1: "+slim1);
		
		System.out.println("********************************************");
		System.out.println("COULD THE REAL SLIM SHADY PLEASE STAND UP?");
		SlimShady slim2 = SlimShady.standUp();
		System.out.println("\tSlimShady.numObjects = "+SlimShady.numObjects+", \n\tslim2: "+slim2);
		
	}
}

/*

```

**Pros:**

* Object is created only if it is needed. It may overcome resource overcome and wastage of CPU time.
* Exception handling is also possible in method.

**Cons:**

* Every time a condition of null has to be checked.
instance can’t be accessed directly.
* In multithreaded environment, it may break singleton property.


### Thread Safe Singletons

`https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-singleton-design-pattern-practices-examples/`   

**Thread Safe Singleton:** A thread safe singleton in created so that singleton property is maintained even in multithreaded environment. To make a singleton class thread-safe, getInstance() method is made synchronized so that multiple threads can’t access it simultaneously.  

```java

class TheRealSlimShady
{
	// private _real, so that it can be 
	// accessed by only by own methods 
	private static TheRealSlimShady _real;	//static ref of same type as self 		
	static int numObjects;
	
	// can't be called from outside the class
	private TheRealSlimShady()
	{
		System.out.println("TheRealSlimShady()");
		numObjects++;
	}

	// SYNCHRONIZED method to control simultaneous access (OPTION 1 & OPTION 2)
	// CON : slow performance (Double check locking mechanism to better this issue)

	// OPTION 1 
	// standUp1() method is synchronized so it causes slow performance as 
	// multiple threads can’t access it simultaneously.
	synchronized public static TheRealSlimShady standUp1()   
	{
		System.out.println("SYNCHRONIZED METHOD");
		if(_real == null)
		{
			_real = new TheRealSlimShady(); 
		}	
		return _real; //return instance that already has been set
	}

	// OPTION 2
	// standUp2() is not synchronized but the block which creates instance IS 
	// synchronized so that minimum number of threads have to wait and that’s 
	// only for first time.

	public static TheRealSlimShady standUp2() 
	{ 
		System.out.println("LAZY INITIALIZATION WITH DOUBLE CHECK LOCKING");
	    if (_real == null)  
	    { 
	      //synchronized block to remove overhead 
	      synchronized (TheRealSlimShady.class) 
	      { 
	        if(_real==null) 
	        { 
	          // if instance is null, initialize 
	          _real = new TheRealSlimShady(); 
	        } 
	        
	      } 
	    } 
	    return _real; 
	  }

	// OPTION 3 = Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation (no synchronization)
	// concept of inner static classes to use for singleton

	// When the singleton class is loaded, inner class is not loaded 
	// and hence doesn’t create object when loading the class. 
  	// Inner class is created only when standUp3() method is called. 
	// So it may seem like eager initialization but it is lazy initialization.

	// Inner class to provide instance of class 
	private static class Slim
	{
		private static final TheRealSlimShady INSTANCE = new TheRealSlimShady(); 
	}

	public static TheRealSlimShady standUp3()
	{
		System.out.println("INNER STATIC CLASSES");
	 	return Slim.INSTANCE;
	}

}

```

**Lazy initialization with Double check locking:** In this mechanism, we overcome the overhead problem of synchronized code. In this method, getInstance is not synchronized but the block which creates instance is synchronized so that minimum number of threads have to wait and that’s only for first time.

**Pros:**

* Lazy initialization is possible.
* It is also thread safe.
* Performance reduced because of synchronized keyword is overcome.

**Cons:**

* First time, it can affect performance.
