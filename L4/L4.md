3 ways to assign a variable:
* declare and initialize at the top

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing = true;   
                      
  Bird(){             

  }
}
```

* declare at top and initialize inside constructor

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;    
                      
  Bird(){             
    canSing = true;
  }
}
```

* create `initialization block` / `init block` (block with no name)

```java
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;   
  {
    canSing = true; 
  }
                      
  Bird(){             

  }
}
```

**Order of execution:**  

1) static initialization blocks of super classes
2) static initialization blocks of the class
3) instance initialization blocks of super classes
4) constructors of super classes
5) instance initialization blocks of the class
6) constructor of the class  

#### Instance initialization block - Runs each time you instantiate an object
  
The instance initialization block is actually copied by the Java compiler into every constructor the class has. So every time the code in instance initialization block is executed exactly before the code in constructor.  

#### Static initialization block - Runs once (when the class is initialized)

The code in static initialization block will be executed at class load time (and yes, that means only once per class load), before any instances of the class are constructed and before any static methods are called.  

```java

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Bird b1 = new Emu();
    Bird b2 = new Blackbird();
    System.out.println( b1.canSing ); // false
    System.out.println( b2.canSing ); // true
  }
}
abstract class Bird{
  boolean canSing;    
                      
  Bird(){             
    
  }
}
class Blackbird extends Bird{
  Blackbird(){
    canSing = true;
  }
}
class Emu extends Bird{
  Emu(){

  }
}

```
