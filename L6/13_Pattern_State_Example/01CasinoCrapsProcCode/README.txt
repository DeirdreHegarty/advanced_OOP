.\src\CasinoCraps.java
A Java source file which is "procedural" and incomplete.

Analyse the game of Casino Craps using the description of the game
provided in the comments at the top of 'CasinoCraps.java', and 
produce _two_ Activity Diagrams:
1) An Activity diagram representing the current state of the code
	(with incompleteness, and errors)
2) An "fixed" and "complete" Activity diagram, where you can 
	ignore the CasinoCraps.java code and just model the game
	logic as you see fit.
