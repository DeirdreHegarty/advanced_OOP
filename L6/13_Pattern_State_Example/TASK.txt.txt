Study the examples of a State design pattern in the
code folders.

1. Briefly explain why the first is "not working"

2. Compare the 02...String against the 03...Enum examples
and comment on which you think is the best approach and why
(use the term 'type-safe' in your response)

3. Briefly compare and contrast the State design pattern
against the Strategy design pattern. Use code and/or UML
diagrams to expalin the difference between the two patterns.
