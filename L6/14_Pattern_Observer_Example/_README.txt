*	The following code-samples are adapted from the "Head First Design Patterns" text book (Freeman et. al, 2004).
*	Chapter 02 of the Head First Design Patterns book (Freeman et. al, 2004a) provides a code-sample
    to demonstrate the "Observer" pattern.

*   The source-code from the book is freely downloadable here: 
	http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfdp/ (see "Book code and downloads" heading)

*	The HeadFirst code has been adapted to remove packages and simplify for 
	teaching and learning purposes.

*	Each folder corresponds to the chapter of the book.
	I.e. ".\_2" is the code for Chapter 02.
