The code in this folder works.

However, it only works for the CurrentConditionsDisplay.

Included in the folder are the classes StatisticsDisplay and ForecastDisplay (in corresponding .java files).
Make changes to the code to make the output show each of these displays.

You may need to study pages 37 - 63 of the HeadFirst Design Pattern book for help.
