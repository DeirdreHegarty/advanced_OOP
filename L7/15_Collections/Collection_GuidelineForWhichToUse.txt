//Some comments:
Suggestions (what do you think?) :

1) From path: ---values---><contains duplicates?>---no---><primary-task searching>---no---> ...

   you could add:

                            ...<high-frequency of insert/delete>---yes--->[LinkedList]

                             (Where: ---no---> would lead back to [ArrayList]

2) From path: ---pairs---><order important>---yes---><insertion order or sorted?>---...

   you could change the labels to ---insertion-order---> && ---sorted-order--->

*Similarly for  the Sets.
