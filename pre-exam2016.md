## Different programming languages implement method-call to method definition (/implementation) binding differently. Compare C++ (static and dynamic) against Java (dynamic only).
* Be able to show a C++ virtual keyword example, with/without dynamic binding.
* Be able to explain by example why a destructor might need to be declared virtual.

## Compare C++ and Java with respect to how the object lifetime is managed in each language. Think here about, static, global, stack-local and heap as well as about object destruction or garbage collection, be able to show example codes where appropriate.

---

## Compare C++ and Java with respect to how a deep copy of an object can be achieved. Briefly explain the difference between a deep and shallow copy of an object in your answer. For C++, explain and show copy-constructor and copy assignment operator.

---

## Both the Java and C++ collection classes have Hashtable and Set data-structures. Compare how you write the code in each language. (E.g. operation1 {Java versus C++}, operation2 {Java versus C++}).

---

## Using Java code-examples, summarize the Exception mechanism. Be able to explain the advantages of using exceptions, and show how the Exception mechanism rules are effected when declaring sub-classes (i.e. when polymorphism takes effect).

## What is the “deadly diamond of death”? Briefly explain using example C++ code and explain. Is this an issue in Java 8, briefly explain.

## Compare and contrast generic types in Java against C++ Template types.
